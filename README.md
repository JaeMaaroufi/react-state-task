# Magic Ball

Welcome to the Magic Ball React Task! Your goal is to create a simple `MagicBall` component in React that generates random responses when it is clicked. This will simulate the experience of asking a question and receiving a mysterious answer from the "magic ball."

The answers are inside an array and are predifined, they can be found inside the `App` component.

### Getting Started

Use the sample code provided as a starting point. Ensure to structure the React component, apply CSS styling, and implement the random response generation to complete the Magic Ball functionality.

The `answers` array is provided in the `App` component which you should pass as a prop to the `MagicBall` component that you're going to create.

Feel free to be creative with the styles and features in this task, Happy Coding!
